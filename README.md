## Cool stuff coming

I have been obsessed with ferrofluids ever since I saw it at a science museum when I was 11 years old.
I want to attempt to make the highlights and shadows smoother and the spikes more spiky, as per the reference imagery.
I would also like to connect a sound library - or maybe a sound oscilator to the code - and use a MIDI controller to control the output.
